      Questions:
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Where do I get the user data from? What is the url of service/api?
      </li>
      <li>
        Should we implement completion/suggestions of country names? Or maybe a dropdown of available countries?
      </li>
      <li>
        What will the user do with this information? Should we offer a friendly way to download/export the filtered data?
      </li>
      <li>
        Will this feature grow? Will this list have other actions like edit, delete?
      </li>
      <li>
        Do we have any guidelines on how the design should look like?
      </li>
